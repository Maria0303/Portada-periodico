    <h1 class="titulo1">Is the covid actually killing us in Colombia?</h1>
    <p class="parrafo1">We are dying, but it is not because of the new disease that has made us save ourselves, the government is killing innocent people, students, children and social leaders. In the course of the year, 43 massacres have been reported by the paramilitaries, drug traffickers, the guerrillas, the army, the narco-state and the police.</p>
    <p class="subparrafocuadro1">President Duque does not stop blaming the security problems on his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, who ended his term two years ago, or on the peace process with the FARC, a narrative that brought him to power.</p>

    <img src="https://aws.traveler.es/prod/designs/v1/assets/940x705/152926.jpg" class="gato" alt="Responsive image">
    <p class="parrafo2">There is no question about it, cats make great pets. You can benefit from a stronger immune system and recover from illness sooner than people who don't have pets.</p>
    <p class="subparrafocuadro2">The cat possesses beauty without vanity, strength without insolence, courage without ferocity, all the virtues of man without his vices.</p>

    <h1 class="titulo3">Are young people safe on social media?</h1>
    <p class="parrafo3">Maybe they are not sure, there are very dangerous people in these media.Pimps, pedophiles, organ thieves, rapists, sociopaths, murderers and more...we don't know what we're up against, no one is sure, not even the elderly. We must all be cautious, not give all our personal information and ensure that our intimate life is safe.</p>  
    <p class="subparrafocuadro3">Social media safety tips: It is clear, then, that today social networks are part of us, as well as our smartphone. If we separate from them, we can even suffer anxiety, stress and emotional instability, something totally unthinkable 50 years ago.</p>

    <h1 class="titulo4">The bogotazo</h1>
    <p class="parrafo4">On April 9, 1948, the liberal caudillo Jorge Eliecer Gaitán was in his office with Plinio Mendoza Neira, Pedro Eliseo Cruz, Alejandro Vallejo and Jorge Padilla. They headed for lunch at 1:00 p.m. and, when they got out of the elevator, Mendoza Neira took Gaitán by the arm and they went ahead of the rest of the people.</p>
    <p class="subparrafocuadro4">Juan Roa Sierra, upon reaching the door, apparently shoots at the politician. Three bullets hit the body of Gaitán, who died a few minutes later in the Central Clinic while his friend, the doctor Pedro Eliseo Cruz, proceeded to perform a blood transfusion.</p>
